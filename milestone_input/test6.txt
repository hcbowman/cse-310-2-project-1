"Things are changing so fast it almost frightens me," Anne thought,
a little sadly.  "And I'm afraid that this can't help making some
difference between Diana and me.  I'm sure I can't tell her all my
secrets after this. . .she might tell Fred.  And what CAN she see
in Fred?  He's very nice and jolly. . .but he's just Fred Wright."

It is always a very puzzling question. . .what can somebody see in
somebody else?  But how fortunate after all that it is so, for if
everybody saw alike. . .well, in that case, as the old Indian said,
"Everybody would want my squaw."  It was plain that Diana DID see
something in Fred Wright, however Anne's eyes might be holden. 
Diana came to Green Gables the next evening, a pensive, shy young
lady, and told Anne the whole story in the dusky seclusion of the
east gable.  Both girls cried and kissed and laughed.

"I'm so happy," said Diana, "but it does seem ridiculous to think
of me being engaged."

"What is it really like to be engaged?" asked Anne curiously.

"Well, that all depends on who you're engaged to," answered Diana,
with that maddening air of superior wisdom always assumed by those
who are engaged over those who are not.  "It's perfectly lovely to
be engaged to Fred. . .but I think it would be simply horrid to be
engaged to anyone else."

"There's not much comfort for the rest of us in that, seeing that
there is only one Fred," laughed Anne.

"Oh, Anne, you don't understand," said Diana in vexation.  "I didn't
mean THAT. . .it's so hard to explain.  Never mind, you'll understand
sometime, when your own turn comes."

"Bless you, dearest of Dianas, I understand now.  What is an imagination
for if not to enable you to peep at life through other people's eyes?"

"You must be my bridesmaid, you know, Anne.  Promise me that. . .
wherever you may be when I'm married."

"I'll come from the ends of the earth if necessary," promised Anne solemnly.

"Of course, it won't be for ever so long yet," said Diana, blushing.
"Three years at the very least. . .for I'm only eighteen and mother
says no daughter of hers shall be married before she's twenty-one.
Besides, Fred's father is going to buy the Abraham Fletcher farm
for him and he says he's got to have it two thirds paid for before
he'll give it to him in his own name.  But three years isn't any too
much time to get ready for housekeeping, for I haven't a speck of fancy
work made yet.  But I'm going to begin crocheting doilies tomorrow.
Myra Gillis had thirty-seven doilies when she was married and I'm
determined I shall have as many as she had."

"I suppose it would be perfectly impossible to keep house with only
thirty-six doilies," conceded Anne, with a solemn face but dancing eyes.

Diana looked hurt.

"I didn't think you'd make fun of me, Anne," she said reproachfully.

"Dearest, I wasn't making fun of you," cried Anne repentantly.
"I was only teasing you a bit.  I think you'll make the sweetest
little housekeeper in the world.  And I think it's perfectly lovely
of you to be planning already for your home o'dreams."

Anne had no sooner uttered the phrase, "home o'dreams," than it
captivated her fancy and she immediately began the erection of one
of her own.  It was, of course, tenanted by an ideal master, dark,
proud, and melancholy; but oddly enough, Gilbert Blythe persisted
in hanging about too, helping her arrange pictures, lay out gardens,
and accomplish sundry other tasks which a proud and melancholy hero
evidently considered beneath his dignity.  Anne tried to banish
Gilbert's image from her castle in Spain but, somehow, he went
on being there, so Anne, being in a hurry, gave up the attempt
and pursued her aerial architecture with such success that her
"home o'dreams" was built and furnished before Diana spoke again.

"I suppose, Anne, you must think it's funny I should like Fred so
well when he's so different from the kind of man I've always said I
would marry. . .the tall, slender kind?  But somehow I wouldn't
want Fred to be tall and slender. . .because, don't you see, he
wouldn't be Fred then.  Of course," added Diana rather dolefully,
"we will be a dreadfully pudgy couple.  But after all that's better
than one of us being short and fat and the other tall and lean,
like Morgan Sloane and his wife.  Mrs. Lynde says it always makes
her think of the long and short of it when she sees them together."

"Well," said Anne to herself that night, as she brushed her hair
before her gilt framed mirror, "I am glad Diana is so happy and
satisfied.  But when my turn comes. . .if it ever does. . .I do
hope there'll be something a little more thrilling about it.  But
then Diana thought so too, once.  I've heard her say time and again
she'd never get engaged any poky commonplace way. . .he'd HAVE to
do something splendid to win her.  But she has changed.  Perhaps
I'll change too.  But I won't. . .and I'm determined I won't.  Oh,
I think these engagements are dreadfully unsettling things when
they happen to your intimate friends."




                                XXX

                  A Wedding at the Stone House

The last week in August came.  Miss Lavendar was to be married in it.
Two weeks later Anne and Gilbert would leave for Redmond College.
In a week's time Mrs. Rachel Lynde would move to Green Gables and
set up her lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room, which was
already prepared for her coming.  She had sold all her superfluous
household plenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the
congenial occupation of helping the Allans pack up.  Mr. Allan was
to preach his farewell sermon the next Sunday.  The old order was
changing rapidly to give place to the new, as Anne felt with a
little sadness threading all her excitement and happiness.

"Changes ain't totally pleasant but they're excellent things,"
said Mr. Harrison philosophically.  "Two years is about long
enough for things to stay exactly the same.  If they stayed
put any longer they might grow mossy."

Mr. Harrison was smoking on his veranda.  His wife had
self-sacrificingly told that he might smoke in the house
if he took care to sit by an open window.  Mr. Harrison
rewarded this concession by going outdoors altogether to
smoke in fine weather, and so mutual goodwill reigned.

Anne had come over to ask Mrs. Harrison for some of her yellow dahlias.
She and Diana were going through to Echo Lodge that evening to help
Miss Lavendar and Charlotta the Fourth with their final preparations
for the morrow's bridal.  Miss Lavendar herself never had dahlias;
she did not like them and they would not have suited the fine
retirement of her old-fashioned garden.  But flowers of any kind
were rather scarce in Avonlea and the neighboring districts that summer,
thanks to Uncle Abe's storm; and Anne and Diana thought that a certain
old cream-colored stone jug, usually kept sacred to doughnuts, brimmed
over with yellow dahlias, would be just the thing to set in a dim angle
of the stone house stairs, against the dark background of red hall paper.

"I s'pose you'll be starting off for college in a fortnight's time?"
continued Mr. Harrison.  "Well, we're going to miss you an awful lot,
Emily and me.  To be sure, Mrs. Lynde'll be over there in your place.
There ain't nobody but a substitute can be found for them."

The irony of Mr. Harrison's tone is quite untransferable to paper. 
In spite of his wife's intimacy with Mrs. Lynde, the best that could
be said of the relationship between her and Mr. Harrison even under
the new regime, was that they preserved an armed neutrality.

"Yes, I'm going," said Anne.  "I'm very glad with my head. . .and
very sorry with my heart."

"I s'pose you'll be scooping up all the honors that are lying round
loose at Redmond."

"I may try for one or two of them," confessed Anne, "but I
don't care so much for things like that as I did two years ago.
What I want to get out of my college course is some knowledge of
the best way of living life and doing the most and best with it.
I want to learn to understand and help other people and myself."

Mr. Harrison nodded.

"That's the idea exactly.  That's what college ought to be for,
instead of for turning out a lot of B.A.'s, so chock full of
book-learning and vanity that there ain't room for anything else.
You're all right.  College won't be able to do you much harm,
I reckon."

Diana and Anne drove over to Echo Lodge after tea, taking with them
all the flowery spoil that several predatory expeditions in their
own and their neighbors' gardens had yielded.  They found the stone
house agog with excitement.  Charlotta the Fourth was flying around
with such vim and briskness that her blue bows seemed really to possess
the power of being everywhere at once.  Like the helmet of Navarre,
Charlotta's blue bows waved ever in the thickest of the fray.

"Praise be to goodness you've come," she said devoutly, "for
there's heaps of things to do. . .and the frosting on that cake
WON'T harden. . .and there's all the silver to be rubbed up yet. . .
and the horsehair trunk to be packed. . .and the roosters for the
chicken salad are running out there beyant the henhouse yet,
crowing, Miss Shirley, ma'am.  And Miss Lavendar ain't to be
trusted to do a thing.  I was thankful when Mr. Irving came
a few minutes ago and took her off for a walk in the woods.
Courting's all right in its place, Miss Shirley, ma'am, but if
you try to mix it up with cooking and scouring everything's spoiled.
That's MY opinion, Miss Shirley, ma'am."

Anne and Diana worked so heartily that by ten o'clock even
Charlotta the Fourth was satisfied.  She braided her hair in
innumerable plaits and took her weary little bones off to bed.

"But I'm sure I shan't sleep a blessed wink, Miss Shirley, ma'am,
for fear that something'll go wrong at the last minute. . .the cream
won't whip. . .or Mr. Irving'll have a stroke and not be able to come."

"He isn't in the habit of having strokes, is he?" asked Diana, the
dimpled corners of her mouth twitching.  To Diana, Charlotta the Fourth
was, if not exactly a thing of beauty, certainly a joy forever.

"They're not things that go by habit," said Charlotta the Fourth
with dignity.  "They just HAPPEN. . .and there you are.  ANYBODY
can have a stroke.  You don't have to learn how.  Mr. Irving looks
a lot like an uncle of mine that had one once just as he was
sitting down to dinner one day.  But maybe everything'll go all
right.  In this world you've just got to hope for the best and
prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends."

"The only thing I'm worried about is that it won't be fine tomorrow,"
said Diana.  "Uncle Abe predicted rain for the middle of the week,
and ever since the big storm I can't help believing there's a good
deal in what Uncle Abe says."

Anne, who knew better than Diana just how much Uncle Abe had to do
with the storm, was not much disturbed by this.  She slept the
sleep of the just and weary, and was roused at an unearthly hour by
Charlotta the Fourth.

"Oh, Miss Shirley, ma'am, it's awful to call you so early," came
wailing through the keyhole, "but there's so much to do yet. . .and oh,
Miss Shirley, ma'am, I'm skeered it's going to rain and I wish
you'd get up and tell me you think it ain't."  Anne flew to the
window, hoping against hope that Charlotta the Fourth was saying
this merely by way of rousing her effectually.  But alas, the
morning did look unpropitious.  Below the window Miss Lavendar's
garden, which should have been a glory of pale virgin sunshine, lay
dim and windless; and the sky over the firs was dark with moody clouds.

"Isn't it too mean!" said Diana.

"We must hope for the best," said Anne determinedly.  "If it only
doesn't actually rain, a cool, pearly gray day like this would
really be nicer than hot sunshine."

"But it will rain," mourned Charlotta, creeping into the room, a
figure of fun, with her many braids wound about her head, the ends,
tied up with white thread, sticking out in all directions.  "It'll
hold off till the last minute and then pour cats and dogs.  And all
the folks will get sopping. . .and track mud all over the house. . .
and they won't be able to be married under the honeysuckle. . .and
it's awful unlucky for no sun to shine on a bride, say what you will,
Miss Shirley, ma'am.  _I_ knew things were going too well to last."

Charlotta the Fourth seemed certainly to have borrowed a leaf out
of Miss Eliza Andrews' book.

It did not rain, though it kept on looking as if it meant to.
By noon the rooms were decorated, the table beautifully laid;
and upstairs was waiting a bride, "adorned for her husband."

"You do look sweet," said Anne rapturously.

"Lovely," echoed Diana.

"Everything's ready, Miss Shirley, ma'am, and nothing dreadful has
happened YET," was Charlotta's cheerful statement as she betook
herself to her little back room to dress.  Out came all the braids;
the resultant rampant crinkliness was plaited into two tails and
tied, not with two bows alone, but with four, of brand-new ribbon,
brightly blue.  The two upper bows rather gave the impression of
overgrown wings sprouting from Charlotta's neck, somewhat after the
fashion of Raphael's cherubs.  But Charlotta the Fourth thought
them very beautiful, and after she had rustled into a white dress,
so stiffly starched that it could stand alone, she surveyed herself
in her glass with great satisfaction. . .a satisfaction which lasted
until she went out in the hall and caught a glimpse through the spare
room door of a tall girl in some softly clinging gown, pinning white,
star-like flowers on the smooth ripples of her ruddy hair.

"Oh, I'll NEVER be able to look like Miss Shirley," thought poor
Charlotta despairingly.  "You just have to be born so, I guess. . .
don't seem's if any amount of practice could give you that AIR."

By one o'clock the guests had come, including Mr. and Mrs. Allan,
for Mr. Allan was to perform the ceremony in the absence of the
Grafton minister on his vacation.  There was no formality about
the marriage.  Miss Lavendar came down the stairs to meet her
bridegroom at the foot, and as he took her hand she lifted her big
brown eyes to his with a look that made Charlotta the Fourth, who
intercepted it, feel queerer than ever.  They went out to the
honeysuckle arbor, where Mr. Allan was awaiting them.  The guests
grouped themselves as they pleased.  Anne and Diana stood by the
old stone bench, with Charlotta the Fourth between them, desperately
clutching their hands in her cold, tremulous little paws.

Mr. Allan opened his blue book and the ceremony proceeded.  Just as
Miss Lavendar and Stephen Irving were pronounced man and wife a very
beautiful and symbolic thing happened.  The sun suddenly burst through
the gray and poured a flood of radiance on the happy bride.  Instantly
the garden was alive with dancing shadows and flickering lights.

"What a lovely omen," thought Anne, as she ran to kiss the bride. 
Then the three girls left the rest of the guests laughing around
the bridal pair while they flew into the house to see that all was
in readiness for the feast.

"Thanks be to goodness, it's over, Miss Shirley, ma'am," breathed
Charlotta the Fourth, "and they're married safe and sound, no
matter what happens now.  The bags of rice are in the pantry,
ma'am, and the old shoes are behind the door, and the cream for
whipping is on the sullar steps."

At half past two Mr. and Mrs. Irving left, and everybody went to
Bright River to see them off on the afternoon train.  As Miss
Lavendar. . .I beg her pardon, Mrs. Irving. . .stepped from the
door of her old home Gilbert and the girls threw the rice and
Charlotta the Fourth hurled an old shoe with such excellent aim
that she struck Mr. Allan squarely on the head.  But it was
reserved for Paul to give the prettiest send-off.  He popped out of
the porch ringing furiously a huge old brass dinner bell which had
adorned the dining room mantel.  Paul's only motive was to make a
joyful noise; but as the clangor died away, from point and curve
and hill across the river came the chime of "fairy wedding bells,"
ringing clearly, sweetly, faintly and more faint, as if Miss
Lavendar's beloved echoes were bidding her greeting and farewell. 
And so, amid this benediction of sweet sounds, Miss Lavendar drove
away from the old life of dreams and make-believes to a fuller life
of realities in the busy world beyond.

Two hours later Anne and Charlotta the Fourth came down the lane again.
Gilbert had gone to West Grafton on an errand and Diana had to keep an
engagement at home.  Anne and Charlotta had come back to put things in
order and lock up the little stone house.  The garden was a pool of
late golden sunshine, with butterflies hovering and bees booming;
but the little house had already that indefinable air of desolation
which always follows a festivity.

"Oh dear me, don't it look lonesome?" sniffed Charlotta the Fourth,
who had been crying all the way home from the station.  "A wedding
ain't much cheerfuller than a funeral after all, when it's all
over, Miss Shirley, ma'am."

A busy evening followed.  The decorations had to be removed,
the dishes washed, the uneaten delicacies packed into a basket for
the delectation of Charlotta the Fourth's young brothers at home.
Anne would not rest until everything was in apple-pie order; after
Charlotta had gone home with her plunder Anne went over the still
rooms, feeling like one who trod alone some banquet hall deserted,
and closed the blinds.  Then she locked the door and sat down under
the silver poplar to wait for Gilbert, feeling very tired but still
unweariedly thinking "long, long thoughts."

"What are you thinking of, Anne?" asked Gilbert, coming down the
walk.  He had left his horse and buggy out at the road.

"Of Miss Lavendar and Mr. Irving," answered Anne dreamily.  "Isn't
it beautiful to think how everything has turned out. . .how they
have come together again after all the years of separation and
misunderstanding?"

"Yes, it's beautiful," said Gilbert, looking steadily down into
Anne's uplifted face, "but wouldn't it have been more beautiful still,
Anne, if there had been NO separation or misunderstanding. . .
if they had come hand in hand all the way through life, with no
memories behind them but those which belonged to each other?"

For a moment Anne's heart fluttered queerly and for the first time
her eyes faltered under Gilbert's gaze and a rosy flush stained the
paleness of her face.  It was as if a veil that had hung before
her inner consciousness had been lifted, giving to her view a
revelation of unsuspected feelings and realities.  Perhaps, after
all, romance did not come into one's life with pomp and blare, like
a gay knight riding down; perhaps it crept to one's side like an
old friend through quiet ways; perhaps it revealed itself in
seeming prose, until some sudden shaft of illumination flung
athwart its pages betrayed the rhythm and the music, perhaps. . .
perhaps. . .love unfolded naturally out of a beautiful friendship,
as a golden-hearted rose slipping from its green sheath.

Then the veil dropped again; but the Anne who walked up the dark
lane was not quite the same Anne who had driven gaily down it the
evening before.  The page of girlhood had been turned, as by an
unseen finger, and the page of womanhood was before her with all
its charm and mystery, its pain and gladness.

Gilbert wisely said nothing more; but in his silence he read the
history of the next four years in the light of Anne's remembered
blush.  Four years of earnest, happy work. . .and then the guerdon
of a useful knowledge gained and a sweet heart won.

Behind them in the garden the little stone house brooded among the
shadows.  It was lonely but not forsaken.  It had not yet done with
dreams and laughter and the joy of life; there were to be future
summers for the little stone house; meanwhile, it could wait.  And
over the river in purple durance the echoes bided their time.
